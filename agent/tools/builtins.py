"""The irreducible set of built-in tools, registered on every agent.

``read_file`` · ``write_file`` · ``list_dir`` · ``run_shell`` (the workhorse) ·
``fetch_url``. Each is a plain function with a docstring + type hints; Pydantic
AI derives the JSON schema from the signature, so there is no schema code of our
own. Tools that need shared state take ``RunContext[AgentDeps]`` as the first
parameter and reach the http client / store / settings via ``ctx.deps``.

**Filesystem sandbox.** ``read_file`` / ``write_file`` / ``list_dir`` resolve
their argument and refuse anything that lands outside the agent's ``workspace/``
— relative ``../`` escapes and absolute paths to elsewhere both return an error
string to the model rather than touching the host filesystem. Set
``sandbox: false`` in ``settings.yaml`` to opt out (trusted setups only). This
guard does NOT extend to ``run_shell``: a shell command can ``cd`` anywhere, so
treat ``run_shell`` as full host access and gate it via the tool policy
(``tools.confirm`` / ``tools.disable``) when that matters.
